# DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-MULTICLASS-CLASSIFICATION-FOR-DENTAL-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-DENSENET-201
This project uses DenseNet-201 for automated detection of five dental diseases, achieving 96% accuracy on a dataset of some intraoral images. This approach highlights deep learningâ€™s potential in precise, scalable dental diagnostics, with plans for real-time clinical integration.
